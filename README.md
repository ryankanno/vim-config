# My .vim configuration

Here be dragons.  I periodically walk my configuration file and fix
things that aren't working for me and/or try to better optimize my development
environment.  As humans, we're generally terrible about it since we're
resistant to change.  If that doesn't suit you, you've been warned.  On the flip,
if this does suit you, it means you'll have an amazing dev editing environment.

People have asked why I don't use [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle). I
totally would if you could map to a particular git commit/has, but it doesn't look
like you can. Unfortunately, I enjoy explicit dependency management. 


## Quick Setup

curl -o - https://raw.github.com/ryankanno/vim-config/master/install.sh | bash

At some point, I will detect if you already have this installed and do the
right thing, like compile command-t and detect a previous installation, but for
now, just bear with me.

## Shortcuts

* Remap jk/kj in insert mode to ESC
* Remap ; to :
