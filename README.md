# My .vim configuration

Here be dragons.  I periodically walk through my configuration file and fix
things that aren't working for me and/or try to better optimize my development
environment.  If that doesn't suit you, you have been warned.  On the flip,
this means you'll have an awesome dev environment.

People have asked why I don't use [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle). I
would if you could map to particular git commit, but it doesn't look
like you can. Unfortunately, I do enjoy explicit dependency management. 


## Quick Setup

curl -o - https://raw.github.com/ryankanno/vim-config/master/install.sh | bash

## Shortcuts

Here's a list of shortcuts I use on the daily.

* Remap jk/kj in insert mode to ESC. - Remapping ESC is good for the soul.
* Remap ; to : - Not having to press shift is pretty amazing.
